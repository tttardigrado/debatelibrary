title: "This House Opposes the use of political messaging in Children's Entertainemnt"
infoslide: "In children's entertainment, a political message specifically addresses issues, policies, or power dynamics related to governance and public affairs. It aims to shape public opinion, influence political decisions, or promote specific political ideologies. Examples of children's media with political messages include The Lorax, Zootopia, and Pocahontas. It should not be confused with apolitical moral messages, which focus on teaching universal values like honesty, kindness, and empathy, and are prevalent in most children's media (e.g. SpongeBob SquarePants, Dora the Explorer, and The Powerpuff Girls). The key distinction that makes a message political lies in whether the message primarily addresses specific political issues as compared to broader ethical principles."
