title: "This House Hopes that the future of humanity is transhumanism"
infoslide: "Transhumanism refers to a future where advanced technologies are used to augment and transcend the biological limitations of humans (e.g. brain-computer interfaces, bionic implants, customizable genetic traits). It is meant to elevate human capabilities beyond their natural level, as opposed to medical uses of technology aimed at restoring basic capabilities (e.g. prosthetics for amputees, curing hereditary diseases)."
