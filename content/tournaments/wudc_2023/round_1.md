infoslide: "A team that's recently gained prominence after great performances at the World Cup has advanced to World Cup finals for the first time. After the semi final, the team's top scorer and most important player, while drunk at a bar, publicly instigated a physical fight against another member of the team. When asked to calm down they continued to double down, causing more of a public disruption and seemingly irreconcilable differences with other members of the team."
