title: "This House Would dissolve the position of High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina"
infoslide: "The High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina is a position that was created in 1995 as part of the Dayton Peace Agreement that ended the Bosnian War. The postholder is appointed by the United Nations Security Council.

The High Representative's powers, without judicial oversight, include introducing or repealing laws or constitutional amendments, removing public officials from office, and banning individuals from running in elections.

For example, in 2021 the outgoing High Representative, Austrian Valentin Inzko, amended existing criminal law to make genocide denial and the glorification of war criminals illegal."
