title: "THS the increasing prominence of data journalism at the expense of qualitative journalism"
infoslide: "Data journalism is a type of journalism reflecting the increased role that numerical data has in the production and distribution of information in the digital era. It reflects the increased interaction between content producers (journalists) and several other fields such as design, computer science and statistics. On the flip side, more traditional forms of journalism are qualitative in approach, focusing more on interpretation and contextualisation."
