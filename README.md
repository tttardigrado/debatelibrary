# Debate Library

Madam Chair, the debaters all around the world, and no matter what country in which they live, currently live in a system of dictatorship. 
They live under a dictatorship known as the lack of organized knowledge, shackled by not knowing about it's existence, constrained by workshops and recorded rounds being spread across several obscure youtube channels, and chained by the fact that heroku has killed most tabs.
They’re unable to reach out to their full potential as debaters.

How are we going to define a **Debate Library** in this debate. We say that in all its forms, it shares the feature of wanting to organize debate knowledge in a single website. That’s what a **Debate Library** means. This knowledge can take the form of **Tournaments**, **Motions**, **Recorded Rounds** and **Workshops**.

**Debate Library** has been inspired by multiple projects (such as 
    [marxists.org](https://www.marxists.org/),
    [The Anarchist Library](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/), 
    [nLab](https://ncatlab.org/),
    [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/))
that share the goal of gathering and organizing knowledge about their specific domains.

**We are very proud to propose.**
