    <h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Madam Chair, the debaters all around the world, and no matter what country in which they live, currently live in a system of dictatorship.
They live under a dictatorship known as the lack of organized knowledge, shackled by not knowing about its existence, constrained by workshops and recorded rounds being spread across several obscure youtube channels, and chained by the fact that heroku has killed most of the tabs.
They’re unable to reach out to their full potential as debaters.</p>
<p>How are we going to define a <strong>Debate Library</strong> in this debate. We say that in all its forms, it shares the feature of wanting to organize debate knowledge in a single website. That’s what a <strong>Debate Library</strong> means. This knowledge can take the form of <strong>Tournaments</strong>, <strong>Motions</strong>, <strong>Recorded Rounds</strong> and <strong>Workshops</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Debate Library</strong> has been inspired by multiple projects (such as <a href="https://www.marxists.org/">marxists.org</a>, <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/">The Anarchist Library</a> and <a href="https://ncatlab.org/">nLab</a>) that share the goal of gathering and organizing knowledge about their specific domains.</p>
<p><strong>We are very proud to propose.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The vast majority of the content on this website was not created by me. The <strong>Debate Library</strong> wouldn&rsquo;t be anything without the amazing work of many people who, over the years, have dedicated their time to competitive debate in many ways. If you are one of these people and, for any reason, don&rsquo;t want some resource to be available here please contact me throught <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ttttardigrado">instagram</a> and I&rsquo;ll remove it as soon as possible.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<p><strong>Debate Library</strong> is fully built on top of open-source technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Styling: <a href="https://picocss.com/">Pico CSS</a> and <a href="https://icons.getbootstrap.com/">BootStrap Icons</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SSG: <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and custom python scripts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Search: <a href="https://pagefind.app/">PageFind</a></p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="i-want-to-help">I Want to help</h2>
<p>First of all, thank you. There are multiple ways of helping depending on your background:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are familiarized with HTML/CSS, Hugo or web programming in general and want to help with the website itself, feel free to submit pull requests <a href="https://github.com/tttardigrado/debatelibrary">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If have a favourite workshop, podcast, or other kind of debate resource that is not in the <strong>Debate Library</strong>, please submit it in the <a href="https://forms.gle/NAbfJBJvqSVfSE4BA">add content form</a> and I&rsquo;ll try to add it as soon as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you found a bug, please report it in the <a href="https://forms.gle/HW9dpzUs3ZpFZjXr5">bug report form</a> or fix it directly by submitting a pull request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to discuss something about the website (or anything else), fell free to DM me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ttttardigrado">instagram</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But the biggest help you can give is simply to use the website and recomend it to other debaters and judges.</p>
